# Problem 5: Domino Chain Formation

## Problem Description

Given a set of dominoes represented by a vector of structures, 
write a recursive function to determine if it is possible to form a
chain by linking all the dominoes together based on matching numbers.

Dominos can be connected end-to-end to form chains, subject to the condition that two dominos can be 
linked together only if the numbers match. For example, you can form a chain consisting of all five of 
these dominos by connecting them in the following order:

Note: In traditional dominos, you can rotate a domino y so that its numbers are reversed. As a 
simplification in this problem, this operation is not allowed, which means that the dominos must appear 
in their original orientation.

## Output
<pre> 2|6 – 6|1 – 1|4 – 4|4 – 4|3 </pre>
