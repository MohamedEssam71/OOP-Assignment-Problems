# Problem 6:  Fractal Pattern Generation

## Problem Description

A Fractal Pattern. Examine this pattern of asterisks and blanks, and write a recursive method that can 
generate patterns such as this.

With recursive thinking, the method needs only seven or eight lines of code (including two recursive 
calls). Your method should look like this:

`
  public static void pattern(int n, int i)
  // Precondition: n is a power of 2 greater than zero.
  // Postcondition: A pattern based on the above example has been
  // printed. The longest line of the pattern has
  // n stars beginning in column i of the output. For example,
  // The above pattern is produced by the call pattern(8, 0)
`

## Input
<pre> a = 8, b = 0 </pre>

## Output
