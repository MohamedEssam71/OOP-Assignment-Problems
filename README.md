CS213: Object Oriented Programming Problem Sheet 1 â€“ C++ Revision

## Objectives
This repository contains programming problems for training on C++ Revision.<br>
It covers topics such as strings, arrays, vectors, structures, recursion, pointers, templates, classes, and file handling. Each problem is described below:

### Problem 0

Write a program that reads in a sentence of up to 100 characters and outputs the sentence with spacing corrected and with letters corrected for capitalization. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem0.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 1

Write a program that converts male speech to inclusive speech that includes both male and female. The program will ask for a sentence, read the sentence into a string variable, and replace all occurrences of masculine pronouns with both-gender pronouns. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem1.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 2

Implement the function `split` that splits a string into a vector of strings based on a delimiter. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem2.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 3

Write a program that manages a list of up to 10 players and their high scores in the computer's memory. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem3.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 4

Implement two printing functions related to binary numbers. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem4.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 5

Build a recursive function to determine if a chain of dominos can be formed. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem5.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 6

Create a pattern of asterisks and blanks using a recursive method. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem6.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 7

Implement a bear game where the goal is to end up with exactly 42 bears. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem7.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 8

Create a smart array class that keeps track of its size and provides various functionalities. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem8.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 9

Write a file comparison facility that compares two files character by character or word by word. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem9.md) for detailed specifications.

### Problem 10

Develop a phishing scanner that scans a file of text for common phishing terms and assigns point values based on their likelihood. Refer to the [problem description](Problem-Descriptions/problem10.md) for detailed specifications.
